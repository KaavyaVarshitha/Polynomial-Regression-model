# Polynomial-Regression-model



## Summary

The dataset used for this regression model is '**Manufacturing**'. The goal of this model is to predict the 'Quality Rating' based on metrics like Temperature (Â°C), Pressure (kPa), Temperature x Pressure, Material Fusion Metric, Material Transformation Metric. Since it is a Polynomial regression model, there can be more than one input. The Model is built using Python in **Google colab** platform. The data is divided into training set and test set. Training set being 80% of the data and the test set being 20% of the data and a graph is plotted based on the training and test set seperately.
